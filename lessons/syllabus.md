## Study Group Description

To understand basic to moderate concepts related to React, Vue, and JS-based front-end frameworks.

## Learning Outcomes

You (the learner) have either gained the fundamental skills related to front-end development, specifically in React or Vue. Or, you have gained new knowledge to add to your existing font-end skills.

## End Result

For the duration of the study group, I will ask that each participant create their own React or Vue app in order to learn concepts on their own. This is not mandatory, but it is highly recommended you implement your own solution to further your learning.

You do not need to create a full blown app. This is simply to practice the concepts at hand or get better at what you already know.

You can create your own solution from scratch, or fork the templates I've created.

## Prerequisites

Please have a basic grasp of HTML5, CSS, and JS/TS. Specifically the ES5 and ES6 specifications. You will gain nothing from this study group if you do not have these fundamental skills.

Typescript and Sass experience.

## Lesson Overview

Most lessons will be conducted via examples in both React and Vue. The lessons will be focused on learning concepts, not details. \*\*Hooks require details.

1. By "concepts" I can't teach you React/Vue in 12 weeks, but I can give you a set of foundational skills that will serve you for the rest of your front-end career.
2. If I have a personal opinion about something, I will label it as such. Most of which is forged from previous experience.
3. This will be a lot of terrible puns and memes. Of which I regert none of them.
4. You will be called on if I have worked with your or not. Be ready.
5. I may or may not volun-tell you to share your code for the previous weeks with the class. Be prepared to show me your tests. Group code reviews are fun.
6. All of this is done to have fun learning. Please speak up if you have something to add or say. Nothing will be more painful if this is just me talking for an hour each time. (The less conversation means the more I randomly call on people.)
